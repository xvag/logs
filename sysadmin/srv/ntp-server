Network Time Protocol â€“ NTP- is a protocol which runs over port 123 UDP
at Transport Layer and allows computers to synchronize time over networks
for an accurate time. While time is passing by, computers internal clocks
tend to drift which can lead to inconsistent time issues, especially on
servers and clients logs files or if you want to replicate servers
resources or databases.

- install ntp server
yum install ntp

- choose pool zone from https://www.pool.ntp.org/

- replace the default servers in the config file:
vim /etc/ntp.conf
 ...
 server 0.gr.pool.ntp.org
 server 3.europe.pool.ntp.org
 server 1.europe.pool.ntp.org
 ...

- allow clients from your networks to synchronize time with this server:
vim /etc/ntp.conf
 ...
 restrict 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap
 ...

(The nomodify notrap statements suggest that your clients are not allowed
to configure the server or be used as peers for time sync.)

- add a log file statement:
vim /etc/ntp.conf
 ...
 logfile /var/log/ntp.log
 ...

- configure firewall:
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ntp
firewall-cmd --reload

- start/enable ntp service:
systemctl start|enable|status ntpd

- verify server time sync:
ntpq -p
date -R

- query and synchronize against a pool of your choice:
ntpdate -q  0.ro.pool.ntp.org  1.ro.pool.ntp.org
