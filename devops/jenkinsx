# Jenkins X Architecture:
https://jenkins-x.io/about/concepts/

# Jenkins X tools:
-- Kubernetes
https://kubernetes.io/
orchestration framework for running a set of containers.
-- Helm
https://helm.sh/docs/
package manager for Kubernetes.
-- Helmfile
https://github.com/roboll/helmfile
 a declarative specification for creating Helm charts.
 Jenkins X uses helmfiles to install, upgrade and configure Helm charts.
-- Kuberhealthy
https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy
a monitoring operator for Kubernetes.
It lets you create your own tests and integrates seamlessly
with tools like Prometheus and InfluxDB.
Jenkins X uses Kuberhealthy to monitor itself.
-- Tekton
https://cloud.google.com/tekton
the pipeline execution engine of Jenkins X.
At the run time, Jenkins X pipelines are converted into Tekton resources
and are executed inside a Kubernetes cluster.
-- Lighthouse
https://github.com/jenkins-x/lighthouse
a lightweight ChatOps-based webhook handler to execute Jenkins X pipelines
on webhooks for multiple Git providers such as GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.
-- Skaffold
https://skaffold.dev/
will build a Docker image, push it to a registry, and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.
It watches the local source code directory and rebuilds and redeploys automatically
whenever the source code changes.
-- Kaniko
https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko
build container images from a Dockerfile.
Kaniko does not use Docker daemon and can be used to build images securely.
-- Kpt
https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/
used to create declarative workflows based on configuration files.
It's also used to update, validate and apply Kubernetes configurations.
-- Octant
https://octant.dev/
used to visualize Kubernetes workloads.
Jenkins X uses it as a plugin for creating a visualization console.
-- Terraform
https://www.terraform.io/
an Infrastructure as Code tool for creating vendor-agnostic infrastructure
in various public clouds.
-- Jenkins
https://www.jenkins.io/
Jenkins X provides interoperability with Jenkins.
-- Nexus
https://www.sonatype.com/products/repository-oss
an open source binary artifact management tool which stores and manages
versioned build artifacts. An in-built Nexus repository manager is used
to ship Jenkins X. Apart from Nexus, Jenkins X community is also working
on a low memory footprint replacement for Nexus called -- Bucketrepo
https://github.com/jenkins-x/bucketrepo
