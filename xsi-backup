XSIBackup - https://33hops.com/

Enviroment:
Both servers have esxi 6.7
SXI ver = 11.2.19 PRO
esxi-a: the server with the VMs
esxi-b: the server to host the backups
ip-b: esxi-b's IP


1. Initial Setup:

on esxi-b:
- enable sshd
- allow ssh on fw

on esxi-a:
- enable sshd & client
- allow ssh on fw
- $ cp xsi.zip /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/xsi/
- $ unzip xsi.zip
- $ chmod -R 0700 * the unzipped files
- $ ./xsibackup --link-srv=[ip-b]

[OR]

- $ chmod -R 0700 install
- ./install

2. Backup:

- OneDiff

The first time the backup is run, it will make a full backup
of your virtual machine.
This will prepare the base disks that will be used as the base
of the following subsequent backups, to merge the diff data with.
The folder will be named after the original VM, thus you MUST use
a different datastore to store your clone copy.
All operations are performed hot, while the VM is running
and users are connected.

OneDiff creates a mirror VM with the _XSIBAK string
appended to the original VM name.
Subsequent differential data is sent to this mirrored VM
and integrated with base data sent there before.
OneDiff has been conceived to make VM backup as light and
fast as possible, by copying just changed bytes from your
running VM to the _XSIBAK mirror.
Once they get to the mirror system, they are integrated
into a single consolidated disk file per .vmdk disk.

Once the first full backup is made, XSIBACKUP-PRO will add the
cloned VM to the inventory as YOURORIGINALVM_XSIBAK and this
new automatically generated VM will be ready to be run by just
starting it up. (Didn't happen - had to register the vm manually)

Nevertheless you should not start this VM unless you want it
to replace the original or reset the OneDiff differential backups
chain, as the .vmdk CIDs will change and the following time you run
your OneDiff job this fact will be detected and XSIBACKUP-PRO will
make an initial full backup restarting the process.

(If you feel curious and you want to test your piled backups are
consistent, simply copy the full folder somewhere else, add the copy
to the ESXi inventory and delete it after you have satisfied your
curiosity.)

Take on account that the first time you initiate a OneDiff backup
all snapshots will be removed, thus if you want a backup that can be
compatible with test VMs or VMs that need to keep pre-existing snapshots,
do not use OneDiff as your --backup-prog, leave this parameter unset
and make a full backup of those VMs instead. OneDiff has been designed
to backup big production VMs, not to be compatible wih test environments.
