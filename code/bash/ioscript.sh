#/*
# * This script should: 
# * - Cycle through the available I/O schedulers on a hard disk while doing
# * a configurable number of parallel reads and writes of files of a configurable size. 
# * - Test reads and writes as separate steps. 
# * - When testing reads make sure youâ€™re actually reading from disk 
# * and not from cached pages of memory; you can flushout the cache by doing:
# * $ echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches, before doing the reads.
# * You can cat into /dev/null to avoid writing to disk.
# * - Make sure all reads are complete before obtaining timing information;
# * this can be done by issuing a wait command under the shell. 
# * - Test writes by simply copying a file (which will be in cached memory after the first read) 
# * multiple times simultaneously.To make sure you wait for all writes to complete
# * before you get timing information you can issue a sync call.
# *
# * The provided script takes two arguments. 
# * The first is the number of simultaneous reads and writes to perform.
# * The second is the size (in MB) of each file. 
# * This script must be run as root as it echoes values into the /proc and /sys directory trees. 
# * Compare the results you obtain using different I/O schedulers.
